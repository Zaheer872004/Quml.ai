                  We love to bring designs to life as a developer, and I aim to
                  do this using whatever front end tools are necessary. My
                  preferred tools are more modern javascript libraries like
                  React.js but I like to use whatever is best for the websites
                  needs. There are several reasons why a business would consider
                  a rebrand and it doesn’t necessarily mean the business has
                  been unsuccessful.{" "}

                  Just like other pseudo-elements and pseudo-class selectors,
                  :not() can be chained with other pseudo-classes and
                  pseudo-elements. For example, the following will add a “New!”
                  word to list items that do not have a .old class name, using
                  the ::after pseudo-element:
