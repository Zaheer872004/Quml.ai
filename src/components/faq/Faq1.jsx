                        People know what an FAQ is, so make that your page
                        title. Don’t overcomplicate things by calling it “Good
                        to Know” or “More Info”. Sometimes people put the
                        frequently asked questions section on their Contact
                        page, but you can create your own page and put it right
                        in your website navigation menu or website footer so
                        it’s easy to find. Getting a straight, quick answer to
                        your question is a relief. So keep answers to a short
                        paragraph if you can, less than 100 words. Answer the
                        entire question in the FAQ without linking away to
